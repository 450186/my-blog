# Trackers

## Random Colour tracker

We started experimenting with trackers. These started off at the center of the page and chose a random direction and just goes round the page. We had an issue where sometimes it would go off the screen, which we then made it so that if it touched the end of the screen it would change direction and remain on the screen using the following code 
```
function edges() {
  //   if (xPos < 0 || xPos > width) {
  //     xPos = width / 2;
  //   }
  //   if (yPos < 0 || yPos > height) {
  //     yPos = height / 2;
  //   }
  //   if (xPos < 0) xPos = width;
  //   if (xPos > width) xPos = 0;

  //   if (yPos < 0) yPos = height;
  //   if (yPos > height) yPos = 0;
  if (xPos < 0) {
    xPos = width-5;
    xPrev = xPos;
  }
  if (xPos > width) {
    xPos = 5;
    xPrev = xPos;
  }
  if (yPos < 0) {
    yPos = height-5;
    yPrev = yPos;
  }
  if (yPos > height) {
    yPos = 5;
    yPrev = yPos;
  }
}
```

## Triangle Tracking

<p text-align = "center">I used the same code as last time but I changed it to be triangles to give a different affect that I liked. I used `Random()` on the colours in both experiments to give it a rainbow effect every time a new triangle/shape is made. I personally find triangles really tricky to make in an instance where we aren't using standard coordinates. I would've liked them to be equal but it is a challenge to do this without using proper coordinates; hence why in the example below they are not all the same length and size. In this case, however, I do not find this to be much of an issue as it still gives a cool effect.</p>

## Ellipsoid Eye

I edited the code to make it 3D using an ellipsoid. Like other experiments I've done when I've attempted to use ellipsoids. Instead of having a continuous line of random movement using the lines of code as follows:
```
  direction+= (noise(xPos/1000, yPos/1000, frameCount*100) - 0.5) * HALF_PI
  step=noise(xPos/150, yPos/240, frameCount/100)*25
  let xStep = cos(direction) * (step*0.5);
  let yStep = sin(direction) * (step*0.5);
```
Whenever we use the inbuilt feature `HALF_PI` it means a full circle. `noise` is a different form of `random`. It is a "less random random" and makes smoother results compared to `random`. The divisions of the `xPos` and `yPos` can be changed to change how smooth it is in the movement and then multiplying it by `HALF_PI` means it can go any direction in a circle. The ellipsoid instead of working its way round the screen starts off in the middle and grows both in width and length, at first it gives the effect that it looks like a eye, which is why I decided to keep it this way.
