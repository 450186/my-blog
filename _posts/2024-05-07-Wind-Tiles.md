#Wind Tiles

This code started out as us testing Vera Molnar's work. This is using "tiles" across a page. I then had creative freedom to change it and see how changing certain lines of code change the way the tiles behaved.
```
  let r2=noise(across/2, down*3, frameCount)
```
this for example was not always like that. This line can change the noise which determines where the circles go on their path. 

[Here's my final experiment using Vera Molnar's method](/my-blog/Code-Experiments/Wind-tiles/index.html)
