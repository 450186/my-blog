# China Population Line Graph

We started learning about datasets and how to display them. It starts off with a json file that has all the information about, in this case, the Chinese population.
This was by far one of the most challenging experiments we have come across in class. It is all pretty much the code we did in class, the only things I felt I had a good enough knowledge of to
change is the colours and adding some text. I did some research into how to do gradients using P5 and it involved putting a script into the index.html file and then creating a gradient and using
the gradient variable created to fill in the lines `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/antiboredom/p5.patgrad/p5.patgrad.js"></script>` is the code used to add gradients. 
I also added text to each line to add the year. I positioned it half way down the lines using trial and error on the positioning. I made another piece of text on each line to get the
max value of each line and display it at the top of the bar. I did this because without it, the graph would have been useless as there was no indication at how big the population actually was or
how much it grew year by year.
