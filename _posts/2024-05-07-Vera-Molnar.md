# Vera Molnar's work using Tiles

## Wind Tiles

This code started out as us testing Vera Molnar's work. This is using "tiles" across a page. I then had creative freedom to change it and see how changing certain lines of code change the way the tiles behaved.
```
  let r2=noise(across/2, down*3, frameCount)
```
this for example was not always like that. This line can change the noise which determines where the circles go on their path.

## Chicken Scratches

I created another piece of work using the tiles method. 
Similar to the other work shown above, I changed it from being ellipsis to being triangles that accidentally turned into lines. 
I have since looked at the code and I know why the triangles did not turn out as expected however I liked the way the accident turned out so I kept it.

## Ellipsoid Tiles

I have once again made another experiment using the tiles method like Vera Molnar. I created this using a bit of my own research into P5. I went onto the website and looked up how ellipsoids and 3d shapes worked. They require you to have `WEBGL` in the canvas set up and then it works the way a normal ellipse would work.
